# Quick Start Guide for GitHub Pages Deployment

## TL;DR - What You Need To Do

You're currently on the `gh-pages` branch. Your existing configuration is already correct for your repository! Follow these steps to set up automated deployment:

### Step 1: Switch to Main Branch
```bash
git checkout main
```

### Step 2: Copy These Files from gh-pages to main

**Important:** These configuration files have been created on the gh-pages branch. You need to copy them to your main branch.

1. **Copy the GitHub Actions workflow:**
   ```bash
   git checkout gh-pages -- .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   ```

2. **Copy the .nojekyll file:**
   ```bash
   git checkout gh-pages -- .nojekyll
   ```

### Step 3: Verify Existing Files on Main Branch

Your configuration is already correct! Just verify:

#### Check `vite.config.ts` (line 7):
**Should be:**
```typescript
base: '/portfolio/',  // âœ… Already correct!
```

#### Check `package.json` (homepage field):
**Should be:**
```json
"homepage": "https://muhddanishaiman.github.io/portfolio/",  // âœ… Already correct!
```

### Step 4: Move .nojekyll to client/public/
```bash
mv .nojekyll client/public/.nojekyll
```

### Step 5: Configure GitHub Repository

1. Go to: https://github.com/muhddanishaiman/portfolio/settings/pages
2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Source:** Select "GitHub Actions"
3. Save

### Step 6: Commit and Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Setup GitHub Pages deployment with Actions"
git push origin main
```

### Step 7: Watch It Deploy! ðŸš€

1. Go to: https://github.com/muhddanishaiman/portfolio/actions
2. Watch the deployment workflow run
3. When complete, visit: **https://muhddanishaiman.github.io/portfolio/**

Every time you push to the `main` branch:

1. GitHub Actions automatically builds your React app
2. Generates optimized static files
3. Deploys them to GitHub Pages
4. Your site updates within a few minutes
