# Portfolio Deployment Guide

## 📦 What's Been Prepared

Your portfolio website is ready for GitHub Pages deployment! Here's what has been set up:

### Configuration Files Created

1. **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`** - GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds
2. **`.nojekyll`** - Prevents GitHub Pages Jekyll processing  
3. **`vite.config.ts.NEW`** - Updated Vite configuration (reference file)
4. **`DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** - Comprehensive deployment guide
5. **`QUICK_START.md`** - Quick start instructions

### What Needs to Be Verified

On the `main` branch, verify that:

1. **`vite.config.ts`** - Base path is `/portfolio/` (should already be correct)
2. **`package.json`** - Homepage URL is correct (should already be correct)

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option A: Automated with GitHub Actions (Recommended)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Automatic deployment on every push to main
- ✅ No manual build steps required
- ✅ Always up-to-date
- ✅ Professional CI/CD workflow

**Setup:**
1. Follow steps in `QUICK_START.md`
2. Configure GitHub Pages to use "GitHub Actions"
3. Push to main branch
4. Deployment happens automatically!

### Option B: Manual Deployment

**Pros:**
- ✅ Full control over when to deploy
- ✅ Can test locally before deploying

**Steps:**
```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

This uses the existing `gh-pages` npm package to deploy the `dist/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.

## 📂 Repository Structure

```
portfolio/
├── main branch (source code)
│   ├── client/          # React frontend
│   ├── server/          # Express backend (for development)
│   ├── attached_assets/ # Your images
│   ├── vite.config.ts   # Build configuration
│   └── package.json     # Dependencies
│
└── gh-pages branch (deployed files)
    └── Built static files served by GitHub Pages
```

## 🌐 Your Website URLs

- **GitHub Pages URL:** https://muhddanishaiman.github.io/portfolio/
- **Repository:** https://github.com/muhddanishaiman/portfolio

## 🔧 Why These Changes?

### Base Path Configuration

GitHub Pages serves your site at `/{repository-name}/`, not at the root. So we need:

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
base: '/portfolio/'  // Must match repository name
```

This ensures all CSS, JavaScript, and image links work correctly when deployed.

### .nojekyll File

GitHub Pages uses Jekyll by default, which ignores files/folders starting with `_`. Modern build tools (like Vite) create files starting with `_`, so we add `.nojekyll` to disable Jekyll processing.

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After deployment, check:

- [ ] Site loads at https://muhddanishaiman.github.io/portfolio/
- [ ] Navigation works (About, Projects, CS Paths)
- [ ] Images load correctly
- [ ] Styling appears correctly
- [ ] All links work
- [ ] No 404 errors in browser console

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Site shows 404
**Fix:** Ensure GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions" in repository settings

### Issue: CSS/JS not loading
**Fix:** Verify base path in `vite.config.ts` is `/portfolio/` with trailing slash

### Issue: Images not showing
**Fix:** Check that images are in `attached_assets/` and imported correctly in components

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Read `QUICK_START.md` for immediate action items
2. Follow the steps to update configuration
3. Push to main branch
4. Monitor the deployment in GitHub Actions tab
5. Visit your live site!
